# Image-Caption-Generator
Automatically describing the content of images using natural language is a fundamental and challenging task. With the advancement in computing power along with the availability of huge datasets, building models that can generate captions for an image has become possible. We employ the use of a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate vocabulary describing the images and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to accurately structure meaningful sentences using the generated keywords. The convolutional neural network compares the target image to a large dataset of training images, then generates an accurate description using the trained captions.
